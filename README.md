# Javascript implementation of esptool

This repository contains a Javascript implementation of [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool), a serial flasher utility for Espressif chips. Unlike the Python-based esptool, `esptool-js` doesn't implement generation of binary images out of ELF files, and doesn't include companion tools similar to [espefuse.py](https://github.com/espressif/esptool/wiki/espefuse) and [espsecure.py](https://github.com/espressif/esptool/wiki/espsecure).

`esptool-js` is based on [Web Serial API](https://wicg.github.io/serial/) and works in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, [version 89 or later](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Serial#browser_compatibility).

## Live demo

## Testing it locally

python3 -m http.server 8008
```

Then open http://localhost:8008 in Chrome or Edge.
